Rteval is a python program written to evaluate the performance of a
realtime Linux kernel on a particular hardware platform. The program
unpacks source code for two loads: hackbench and a Linux kernel
compile, then loops running hackbench and a parallel build of the
Linux kernel. While the loads are running, the cyclictest program is
run to measure realtime performance under load. When the specified run
duration is met, the loads are stopped and cyclictest outputs measured
timer latency values in histogram format, which is analyzed by
rteval. Rteval then writes an XML file to disk with information about
the system (gotten through DMI tables), the raw histogram data
collected during the run and the statistical analysis of the run. 

The rteval source may be pulled from it's git tree on kernel.org:
    git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/clrkwllms/rteval.git
